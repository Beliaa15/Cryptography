          <p>Attackers can bypass cryptography, hack into computers that are responsible for data encryption and decryption, and exploit weak implementations, such as the use of default keys. However, cryptography makes it harder for attackers to access messages and data protected by encryption algorithms.</p><br />
        <p>Growing concerns about the processing power of quantum computing to break current cryptography encryption standards led the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to put out a call for papers among the mathematical and science community in 2016 for new public key cryptography standards. Unlike today's computer systems, quantum computing uses quantum bits (qubits) that can represent both 0s and 1s, and therefore perform two calculations at once. While a large-scale quantum computer may not be built in the next decade, the existing infrastructure requires standardization of publicly known and understood algorithms that offer a secure approach, according to NIST. The deadline for submissions was in November 2017, analysis of the proposals is expected to take three to five years.</p><br />
